# ArithmeticWebApp
web applications using stateless session beans and implement the following  Arithmetic operations: addition and multiplication.


**Problem statement** 

Create a web application that will do the following: 

• Allow a user to practice addition and multiplication. The computer must ask a question based 
on the user’s choice. The user must be allowed to answer. The answer must be compared to 
the correct answer, and an outcome must be displayed. 

**• Display the following summary at the end of a session:**

o The total number of addition operations requested.

o The total number of correct answers. 

o The total number of wrong answers. 

• The answers provided by the user must not be less than 2. Also, the program must not allow 
non-numeric answers. References to nonexistent resources must be handled.


**Solution approach** 

The problem will be solved as follows: 

1. Launch NetBeans. 
2. Create a web application project. 
3. Create HTML and JSP files. 
4. Compile the web project to get a WAR (Web ARchive) file. 
5. Start the Application Server (Glassfish). 
6. Deploy the WAR file on Glassfish. 
7. Execute the WAR file using the browser.
